The management would like to get some insights on the usage of bluecars  and identify whether the Blue cars taken in postal code 75015 are the same as Blue Cars taken in Postal Code 75016.

The dataset to be analysed is http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset and the random variable to be analysed is ‘BlueCars_taken_sum’ which is the number of bluecars used on a daily basis.

Hypothesis : The mean number of Bluecars are picked up in postal code 75015 and 75016.

NULL HYPOTHESIS: The average number of Blue cars taken from Postal code 75015 Paris over weekend is the same as those taken in Postal Code 75016.
ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS: The average number of Blue cars taken from Postal code 75015 Paris over the weekend is not the same as those taken in Postal Code 75016. 

Ho : μ of 75015 = μ of 75016

Ha : μ of 75015 ≠ μ of 75016

The hypothesis will be testing the mean number of Bluecars are picked up in postal code 75015 and 75016.The Population standard deviation is 185.

I will be using the Z-test for a mean, since my sample is going to be more than 30 and the population standard deviation is known. 

I will be comparing two means from the two specific postal codes.

The level of significance used is 0.05
